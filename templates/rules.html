  <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Select 3 golfers from the top 20 in the World Rankings that are playing in the tournament (Golfers 1-3 on the website) and 3 other golfers from the field (Golfers 4-6). 6 golfers all together. Cumulative score of the best 5 of 6 golfers you pick will determine the winner. If one of your players misses the cut, he automatically gets the score of whomever finished last on Sunday, plus 2 shots. For example, I pick Tiger who misses the cut. If Bubba finishes last on Sunday at +10, then Tiger's score is +12. Players who withdraw will be treated as if they didn't make the cut, no matter when they withdraw. The same goes for players who are picked, but are not in the field. Likewise, if you pick the winner, you get 3 shots subtracted from your score (Rory wins at -10, it is scored in the pool as -13).  Throughout the weekend, if there is a player solely in first place, he will have the 3 shots subtracted from his score. The first tie breaker will be the total score of your 6 selected golfers, without dropping your high score, and the second tiebreaker is the total amount of birdies the winner of the tournament will make in his 4 rounds.</p>
